# Parallel-Computing-Advisory-Locks

- This repository holds the code for implementing the Advisory Locks around the resources in parallel computing environment through mutex locks to ensure the consistency, availability and partitioning (Basically, CAP Theorem) 

- This locking system lies underneath all of the parallel computations and is crucial in any distributed computing environment to maintain the consistency, availability and partitioning tolerance (CAP).
